# Pewlett-Hackard Silver Tsunami Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of the analysis is as follows:
1. Identify employees who are retiring soon by their current titles;
2. Determine the number of retiring employees by their current titles; and
3. Identify current mentorship eligible employees by their titles in order to match them with retiring employees for mentorship opportunities.

## Key Findings
Number of retiring employees by title:

![Image of retiring_titles](https://github.com/hwaijiinlee/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/retiring_titles.png)
- Almost 58,000 retiring employees hold senior positions like Senior Engineer and Senior Staff within the organisation;
- Almost 50,000 retiring employees occupy positions that require specialized skills like engineers and technique leaders.
- There are only 2 managers who are retiring; and
- When we restrict the criteria to those born in 1965 for mentorship opportunities, there are only over 1,500 employees who are eligible.

## Summary
Number of mentorship eligible employees by title:

There are altogether over 90,000 employees who will be retiring soon and only 1,549 employees who are eligible for mentorship. That is wholly inadequate. We would either have to broaden our mentorship eligibility criteria to include employees of a wider age range or be prepared to invest in automation that is capable of replacing the large swarth of skilled employees who are slated to retire around the same time.
