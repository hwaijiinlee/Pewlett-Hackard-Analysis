# Pewlett-Hackard Silver Tsunami Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of the analysis is to understand the magnitude of the employees who are retiring very soon, identify mentorship eligible employees by their current titles, and match them to younger employees so that the organization has better trained and mentored employees to take over the group of retiring employees. 

## Key Findings
Number of retiring employees by title:

![Image of retiring_titles](https://github.com/hwaijiinlee/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/retiring_titles.png)
- Almost 58,000 retiring employees hold senior positions like Senior Engineer and Senior Staff within the organisation;
- Almost 50,000 retiring employees occupy positions that require specialized skills like engineers and technique leaders.
- There are only 2 managers who are retiring; and
- When we restrict the criteria to those born in 1965 for mentorship opportunities, there are only over 1,500 employees who are eligible.

## Summary
Number of mentorship eligible employees by title:

![Image of mentorship eligibility count](https://github.com/hwaijiinlee/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/mentorship_eligibility.png)

There are altogether over 90,000 employees who will be retiring soon. That is a very large number to replace!

When we restrict the mentorship eligible criteria to just employees born in 1965, we only have 1,549 employees who are eligible for mentorship. That is a significant shortfall compared to the group of retiring employees. Each of those mentors would have to mentor about 60 employees in order to fill the over 90,000 roles that will be vacated. That is not an ideal mentorship relationship we want. We would have to consider either expanding the number of mentors from "retirement-ready" groups to beyond those born in 1965 or include some of the retiring employees as mentors, even if it were to be for a short time.
